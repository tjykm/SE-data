The first line in "RandomMeasure.txt" consists of the number of random measurements (including independent and dependent random measurements) and the number of random line parameters.

====================================================================
The second part is the parameters of the random measurements and the data format is as follows.

       1                 2              3...
Measurement No.    Distribution    Parameters

For "Normal" distribution, the "Parameters" consists of 1)the expectation; 2)the standard deviation.
For "Weibull" distribution, the "Parameters" consists of 1)(NO-USE); 2)(NO-USE); 3)scale parameter; 4)shape parameter; 5)(NO-USE); 6)rated active power of wind farm; 7)cut-in wind speed; 8)rated wind speed; 9)cut-off wind speed.
For "Beta" distribution, the "Parameters" consists of 1)(NO-USE); 2)rated active power of photovoltaic farm; 3)the alpha parameter; 4)the beta parameter.

Note: "Dependent" distribution is used to describe those reactive power injections related to active power injections.
The "Parameters" consists of the random measurement number of the corresponding active power injection and the ratio (Q/P). 
====================================================================
The third part is the parameters of the random line parameters and the data format is as follows.

   1            2              3                 4
Line No.    Ratio(R/X)    Expectation    Standard deviation

Note: The random parameter of a transmission line is its reactance(X) with its resistance(R) equal to X*Ratio as X changes.
